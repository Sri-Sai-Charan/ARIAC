# Policy for updates to the ARIAC software

<!--When changes that will affect participants' code are introduced, the [ARIAC updates page](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2019/updates) will list the change.-->

When changes that will affect participants' code are introduced, the [ARIAC updates page](../misc/updates.md) will list the change.

## During the Finals

- The final version of the ARIAC software will be released in advance of the competition Finals so that participants can test their code against that version of the software.
- Changes will not be released into the software after it has been declared 'final', so that teams can test with the exact version used during the Finals.

## During the Qualifier

- So as not to impact ARIAC participants while a qualification task is open for submissions, breaking changes will only be released into the ARIAC software once qualification has closed.
- However, bug fixes/behavioral corrections may be released into ARIAC software during the period that a qualification task is open for submissions.

- Emails will be sent to participants when new updates are made available.

# Policy for updates to the ARIAC rules

- Updates may be made to the rules/scoring metrics at any time throughout the Qualifier at the discretion of the competition controllers.
- This includes the available sensors/costs, the permitted competition interface, submission requirements, and scoring parameters.
- Where possible advanced notice of these changes is listed on the updates page.
  The final rules/scoring metrics will be confirmed to teams in advance of the competition Finals.
